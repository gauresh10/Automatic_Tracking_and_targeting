To build the actual turret frame we used the VEX motors, gears, screws, and nuts. This piece has the pan motor and gears attached to it.  The entire turret rides on the 84-tooth gear. 
On top of the 84-tooth gear, build a simple U-shaped bracket out of the VEX metal.  This is going to be the bracket that allows the gun to tilt up and down.  On one of the sides of this U-bracket, attach the motor and 12-tooth and 84-tooth gear.  By using a small gear to drive a larger gear, the turret can tilt very precisely and smoothly. Attach the airsoft gun to the 84 tooth tilt gear.
